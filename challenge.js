## Football Points

You have been hired by a football team to create a function that calculates their points based on the number of wins, draws and losses. The points system is as follows:
* A win earns the team 3 points
* A draw earns the team 1 point
* A loss earns the team 0 points

##### Your Task 😃:

Write a function called calculatePoints that takes in 3 arguments:
* wins (a number): representing the number of wins the team has
* draws (a number): representing the number of draws the team has
* losses (a number): representing the number of losses the team has

The function should log the total number of points the team has earned based on the above points system.

#### Example
```
calculatePoints(5,2,3); // Output: 17
```
For example, if the team has won 5 games, drawn 2 games and lost 3 games, their total points would be: (5 x 3) + (2 x 1) + (3 x 0) = 17.

Your function should return the log 17.

Good Luck 😀

function calculatePoints(wins, draws, losses){
    let total = wins*3 + draws*1 + losses*0;
    console.log(total);
}

calculatePoints(5,2,3);
